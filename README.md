Crude tilemap implementation with A\* pathfinding

## TODO:

- Proper pathfinding
  - maybe get euclid closest candidates then A\* to get best
  - get closest candidates to that point, cross reference with first candidates
  - negative points for backtracking
- zone weights, maybe different pathfinding package
- Separate presentation and logic in UI
- Stuffs
- Call mom, dad
